<blockquote><p style="text-align:left; color: #1f1f1f;font-size: 20px "><b>The automobile</b> was first invented and perfected 
    in Germany and France in the late 1800s,though Americans quickly came to dominate the automotive industry in the first half
     of the twentieth century. Henry Ford innovated mass-production techniques that became standard, and Ford, General Motors 
     and Chrysler emerged as the “Big Three” auto companies by the 1920s.Manufacturers funneled their resources to the military 
     during World War II, and afterward automobile production in Europe and Japan soared to meet growing demand. Once vital to 
     the expansion of American urban centers, the industry had become a shared global enterprise with the rise of Japan as the
      leading automaker by 1980.<br><br>
    Although the automobile was to have its greatest social and economic impact in the United States, it was initially perfected in Germany and France toward the end of the nineteenth century by such men as Gottlieb Daimler, Karl Benz, Nicolaus Otto and Emile Levassor.</p></blockquote>

    <p style="text-align:left; color: #1f1f1f;font-size: 60px "><u>When Were Cars Invented?</u></p>
    <blockquote><p style="text-align:left; color: #1f1f1f;font-size: 20px ">The 1901 Mercedes, designed by Wilhelm Maybach for 
        Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft,deserves credit for being the first modern motorcar in all essentials.<br><br>Its thirty-five-horsepower
         engine weighed only fourteen pounds per horsepower, and it achieved a top speed of fifty-three miles per hour. By 1909, with the 
         most integrated automobile factory in Europe, Daimler employed some seventeen hundredworkers to produce fewer than a
         thousand cars per year.</p>

         <br><br>
         <blockquote><p style="text-align:left; color: #1f1f1f;font-size: 20px "> Nothing illustrates the superiority of European design better than the sharp contrast between this first Mercedes model
        and Ransom E. Olds‘ 1901-1906 one-cylinder, three-horsepower, tiller-steered, curved-dash Oldsmobile, which was merely a
        motorized horse buggy. But the Olds sold for only $650, putting it within reach of middle-class Americans, and the 1904
        Olds output of 5,508 units surpassed any car production previously accomplished.<br><br>The central problem of 
        automotive technology over the first decade of the twentieth century would be reconciling the advanced design of the 1901
         Mercedes with the moderate price and low operating expenses of the Olds. This would be overwhelmingly an American achievement.

    <blockquote><p style="text-align:left; color: #1f1f1f;font-size: 20px "> The automotive industry is currently experiencing three
         simultaneous revolutions: first, the electric car; second, the autonomous and connected car; and third, digital mobility.
          The scale of this industry upheaval is unprecedented, exceeding even the major changes undergone by the automobile since 
          it was first invented. As well as being simultaneous, all three revolutions are extremely fast-paced. And I firmly believe 
          that these rapid transformations will reconcile the car with the city. <br>
        World history has taught us that economic development and mobility go hand in hand.
